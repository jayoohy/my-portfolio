You are a senior frontend engineer and product designer.

Your task is to build my **personal software developer portfolio** using:

- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Framer Motion (for animations)

This project must be completed **step by step** and in a **controlled, trackable way**.

---

## GLOBAL RULES (IMPORTANT)

1. BEFORE creating any page or component:

   - Create a `TODO.md` file at the project root.
   - The TODO list must outline every step needed to complete the portfolio.
   - Use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for each task.
   - As tasks are completed, update the file and mark them as done (`- [x]`).

2. NEVER skip steps.
3. Always update `TODO.md` before moving to the next task.
4. Do not remove unchecked tasks.
5. Keep the TODO list clean and readable.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is a **portfolio website** for a software developer specializing in:

- Frontend Designer
- AI workflow automation
- Chatbots
- Technical blogging

The site must feel:

- Modern
- Professional
- Minimal
- Motion-enhanced but not flashy

## TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- Framer Motion for:
  - Page transitions

---

## UI DESIGN

- About (bio, personal info, tools)
- Resume (education, experience, awards, tech stacks)
